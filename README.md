# robotic-package-sorting
CS 123 final project to sort and deliver boxes in a warehouse using small "Hamster" robots.
Developed by Ethan Li and Geetanjali Johary.

## Unit Tests
Unit tests are in the `test/` directory. To run a unit test with filename `foobar.py`, run `python -m test.foobar` from the root directory of this project. Or, if your python 2 distribution uses another command (e.g. `python2`), run with that command (e.g. `python2 -m test.foobar`).

## Dependencies
This project requires the proprietary Hamster API by Kre8 Technology, Inc, which depends on python 2. Thus, this project is written for compatibility with python 2. Binaries of the Hamster API are distributed under the `hamster/` directory and documented in files under the `doc/` directory.
